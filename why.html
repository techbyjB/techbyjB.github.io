    <h2>Why I prefer dogs over cats.</h2>
    <p>I would prefer dogs over cats because dogs are loyal and kind, while cats may be selfish and are not loyal. 
        Dogs are a pal you need for comfort, and can even help with daily things like moping the floor, as long as he/she is trained.
        Dogs also help you stay active because of their companionship towards you.
        Dogs reduce anxiety and you won't ever be lonely. Dogs can also relieve stress and suprisingly are actually good for your heart.
